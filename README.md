Analyzing the time series of Grass Minimum Temperature by degrees Celsius, from the dataset weather_revised using different methods of forecasting. The purpose is to recognize the pattern of the series time from 2019 to 2022 and to apply the best model for performing the prediction of future values in the data set test, which contains values from January 2023 to October 2023. The time series models reported in this project are Simple Time Series Models, Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA/ SARIMA. On the other hand, analyzing, preprocessing, and a dataset that contains information about cardiac information, the purpose of this analysis is to evaluate if it is affected the presence or absence of cardiac conditions by factors like age, weight, gender, or fitness score. The most popular method for solving problems that involve quantitative variables is Linear Regression or Multiple Regression, even though not always happen, there are many areas where a predictor is categorical, so it can use Logistic Regression to provide valuable predictions.

Keywordsâ€”Time Series, prediction, Temperature, Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, Logistic Regression, Cardiac Condition.
